Features to implement:
----

- Log data (subject information; experiment parameters; events like presentations, responses, etc.) to a file
  - Send log file somewhere (email, server, iTunes)

- Get experiment settings from a JSON config file
  - https://github.com/stig/json-framework

- Create stimulus pool from images in a folder or words in a text file

- Put stimlui in a dictionary so they can have properties. Not sure how to generalize setting properties via the config file.

- Stimulus randomization method

- Stimulus pool sub-selection method (for dividing up study and test items)

- Jitter for time durations (stimulus presentaiton, ISI, etc.)


Bugs to fix:
----

- Remove back button during instructions (only have it there during phase 1? or maybe have an intro screen?)


New experiment ideas:

- Probing for data every now and then
